# zipfs-law-demo
random strings of letters to demonstrate zipfs law

Hello! This project was inspired by a video from VSauce (https://youtu.be/fCn8zs912OE?t=8m23s)
and the explanation for why this comes out like it does is best shown there.

To use this demo, please first enter a number of words to generate. 100,000 shows the distribution quite well.

After, enter a file path, which you can directly copy from file explorer.

Finally, add a file name, something like "output.txt"

All of the words will be printed as they're generated, and then the count of each word length will be in the file.

The most ocurring word length *should* be 0, followed by 1 at 26/27^1 times as much, 2 at 26/27^2 times as much, and so on.

I hope you learn something and enjoy the demo :)
